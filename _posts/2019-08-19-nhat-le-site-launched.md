In this post, I'm going to talk about how I created this website using Github Pages. I had wanted to create this page for a while but never had enough motivation to do it. Then I read this nice blog post by [Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/)

Here, I summarize the main points and resources that helped me get this blog running. Will update this later if time permits:
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is your friend. 
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is also a friend. It basically integrates well with github.io. You write your blog posts as markdown files in a `_posts/` folder, and all your files get compiled automatically on the website.
* For tips on how to put everything together, go [here](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
