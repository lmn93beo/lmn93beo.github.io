So, I'm starting to build my own website. The thing that finally pushes me to do it: [Andrej Karpathy's blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/)

Some tips that I find helpful from reading and the building process:
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is your friend. 
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is also a friend. It basically integrates well with github.io. You write your blog posts as markdown files in a `_posts/` folder, and all your files get compiled automatically on the website.
